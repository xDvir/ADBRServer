# ADBR-Server

A modern implementation of the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) server written in Rust, focusing on code maintainability, stability, and better error handling. Currently supports Linux systems and USB devices only (for now).

This server works in tandem with the [ADBR Client](https://github.com/xDvir/ADBRClient) to provide a complete ADB replacement solution. Together, they offer enhanced stability, better error handling, and unique features when used as a pair. Future releases will introduce exclusive features that leverage the client-server collaboration.

The ADBR project aims to improve the Android debugging experience. We welcome:
- Features you've always wanted in ADB
- New use cases for device management
- Any other enhancement ideas

For client installation and documentation, please visit the [ADBR Client repository](https://github.com/xDvir/ADBRClient).

## Why ADBR-Server?

- üìù Clean, modern Rust implementation compared to AOSP's C-based ADB server
- ‚ú® Improved error handling and stability
- üöÄ Well-structured and maintainable codebase
- üîç Proven stability with multiple devices (successfully tested with 16+ concurrent device connections)
- üîî Innovative device actions system

Key improvements over traditional ADB server:
- Clear separation of concerns in the codebase
- Modern Rust error handling patterns
- Well-structured protocol implementation
- Comprehensive logging system
- Automated device actions system

## Requirements

- Linux-based system (currently optimized for Ubuntu 20.04 or newer)
- USB-connected Android device(s) with debugging enabled

## Installation

### Option 1: Install from DEB Package (Recommended)
```bash
# Install runtime dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y libusb-1.0-0

# Download and install
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xDvir/ADBRServer/main/releases/adbr-server_1.0.0-1.deb
sudo dpkg -i adbr-server_1.0.0-1.deb

# If needed, resolve dependencies
sudo apt-get install -f
```

### Option 2: Build from Source
```bash
# Install build dependencies
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/xDvir/ADBRServer.git
cd ADBRServer
./build_deb.sh
```

# Server Usage

First, install the ADBR server following the installation instructions above, then install the ADBR client from: [ADBR Client repository](https://github.com/xDvir/ADBRClient). Ensure your Android device is connected via USB with debugging enabled.

## Starting the Server

```bash
Usage: adbr-server <command> [options]

Commands:
  start-server    Start the ADBR server in background
  kill-server     Kill the running ADBR server
  restart-server  Restart the ADBR server

Options:
  -a             Listen on all network interfaces (default: localhost only)
  -p <port>      Specify port number (default: 5037)

Examples:
  adbr-server start-server
  adbr-server start-server -a -p 5038
  adbr-server kill-server
  adbr-server restart-server
```

Make sure the normal ADB server is not running (kill it if necessary):
```bash
adb kill-server
```
Then start the server:
```bash
adbr-server start-server
```

Finally, test device connection:
```bash
adbr devices
```

## ADBR-Server Actions

The ADBR-Server includes a powerful Actions system that sets it apart from standard ADB implementations. This feature enables automated responses to device events, making it perfect for development environments, testing labs, and automated workflows.

### Action Types

1. Global Actions
    - Apply to all devices
    - Useful for general logging, notifications, or system maintenance

2. Device-Specific Actions
    - Triggered only for specific device serial numbers
    - Perfect for device-specific setup or testing workflows

### Configuration

The Actions system uses a YAML configuration file located at:
`~/.config/adbr-server/actions.yml`

Example configuration:
```yaml
# Global actions for all devices
global:
  connect:
    - id: "connect-notify"
      cmd: "~/.config/adbr-server/scripts/connect.sh {serial}"
  disconnect:
    - id: "disconnect-notify"
      cmd: "~/.config/adbr-server/scripts/disconnect.sh {serial}"

# Device-specific actions
devices:
  "PIXEL6PRO123":
    connect:
      - id: "pixel-connect"
        cmd: "~/.config/adbr-server/scripts/pixel_connect.sh {serial}"
```

### Example Action Script

Here's a practical example of a device connection notification script:

```bash
# ~/.config/adbr-server/scripts/connect.sh
#!/bin/bash
SERIAL=$1
MANUFACTURER=$(adbr -s $SERIAL shell getprop ro.product.manufacturer)
MODEL=$(adbr -s $SERIAL shell getprop ro.product.model)
ANDROID=$(adbr -s $SERIAL shell getprop ro.build.version.release)

# Play sound if exists
if [ -f "/usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/device-added.oga" ]; then
    paplay /usr/share/sounds/freedesktop/stereo/device-added.oga
fi

# Visual notification using zenity
zenity --info \
  --title="ADBR Device Connected" \
  --width=300 \
  --text="Device Details:\n\nSerial: $SERIAL\nManufacturer: $MANUFACTURER\nModel: $MODEL\nAndroid: $ANDROID"
```

When a device connects, this script will display a notification like this:

![ADBR Device Connected Notification](images/ADBR-Server_connect_action.png)

*Example notification showing device details including serial number, manufacturer, model, and Android version*

### Use Cases
